### Data Overview
The data used herein was derived from the specialised domain of industrial maintenance operations in the mining sector. The data set was acquired from the *Excavators_Raw&Cleaned* set hosted on the Prognostics Data Library (https://prognosticsdl.ecm.uwa.edu.au/pdl/)*.

#### Annotation
The parallel corpus *im_pub.json* was annotated by a single user using a meta tag schema consisting of *domain_specific*, *sensitive*, *unsure*, and *noise*. No cross-validation with other annotators or resolution to annotations has been performed herein. The resources accompanying this annotation effort are also provided (see `im_pub_map_<meta_tag>.txt` and `im_pub_map_replacements.json`).
