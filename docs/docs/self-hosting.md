# Self-hosting LexiClean

In this document, we explore how you can deploy LexiClean within your own environment to overcome issues pertaining organisational data privacy policies which inhibit their upload onto web-based platforms. While this guide will give you information to perform this, it is encouraged that you use our hosted version unless absolutely necessary to avoid any potential data losses or issues. While we are not certified, a key philosophy of our application is users control their own data, so please refer to our privacy policy on [data storage](privacy-policy#2-data-storage) to verify whether it is suitable for your situation.
