# Annotating Your Project

To begin annotating your project, navigate to the [Annotation View](/category/annotation-view) by clicking on the `Annotate` button located on your project's card within the [Project Feed](../interface/projects). This section of the basic tutorial will guide you through enhancing your dataset's quality by identifying and correcting low-quality text segments, such as out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. LexiClean simplifies this task by automatically highlighting OOV words in orange, while in-vocabulary (IV) words are displayed in a standard color. You can edit and interact with tokens by right-clicking on them.


<Box display='flex' alignItems='center' justifyContent='space-evenly' sx={{textAlign:'center'}}>
  <Box display='flex' alignItems='center' flexDirection='column'>
    <Token
        token={{
        value: "engine",
        currentValue: "engine",
        replacement: null,
        suggestion: null,
        en: true,
        }}
        isSelected={true}
    />
    <span>In-vocabulary (IV) token</span>
  </Box>
  <Box display='flex' alignItems='center' flexDirection='column'>
    <Token
        token={{
        value: "rpl",
        currentValue: "rpl",
        replacement: null,
        suggestion: null,
        en: false,
        }}
        isSelected={true}
    />
    <span>Out-of-vocabulary (OOV) token</span>
  </Box>
</Box>

## Editing Your First Token

When you encounter an orange token, such as `rpl`, it indicates an out-of-vocabulary word, signifying non-standard or noisy text. To edit this token, left-click on it and change its content to `replace`. Upon editing, a popover will appear, showing the transformation you're about to make. After making your edit, left-click the `Apply` button to save the change. This process is known as a **Replacement**, a type of **Token Transformation** in LexiClean. Following the replacement, the token will turn green, indicating the successful update. Additionally, a bar will appear beneath the token; clicking this bar reveals token-level operations available for further actions, though we'll explore these in more detail later (for the eager, find out more [here](../interface/annotation/tokens)).

<Box display='flex' alignItems='center' justifyContent='space-evenly' sx={{textAlign:'center'}}>

    <Token
        token={{
        value: "rpl",
        currentValue: "replace",
        replacement: "replace",
        suggestion: null,
        en: true,
        }}
        isSelected={true}
    />
    <span>Token with replacement</span>
  </Box>
</Box>
