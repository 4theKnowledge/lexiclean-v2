# Annotation and Transformation Types and Operations

All of the interactions with texts and tokens are categorised under types of **annotations**. In this section, the types of annotations and how they link to different types of actions in LexiClean are outlined. There are numerous annotation types in LexiClean which support the multi-task annotation and transformation of texts.

## Token-based Annotations

## Token Transformations

Token (word) transformations are operations that transform the content of your project's texts. In LexiClean, modifications to tokens are referred to as `replacements`. Replacements can be either `suggested` or `accepted`.
